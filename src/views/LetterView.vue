You have brought such light to my life u are such an important person and u should never let people feel like u are less than what u truly are. i hope to spend the rest of the days of my life giving u silly advice that hopefully counts for something. i actually hope u have the best day ever cause u dont deserve anything less, u deserve to be loved today and everyday by everyone. i hope 19 treats u as good as it treat me and even better!!!!!!!! its so beautiful to watch u grow into a more mature and bigger person after FOUR years together like u might not notice but its so beautiful to watch it from the side lines. the jennie to my lisa THANK YOUUU for being yourself always i wouldnt want anything else. okay on a serious note u literally mean the world to me like u are such an important person that really can brighten the darkest days, u are such a big hearted person. my biggest wish for strangers is that everyone could have u in their life so they'd feel like i do about u and know how u are such an incredible person. u are now in uni!! which is such an important character i hope u get to grow and become everything you've ever wanted, i hope and i know u will achieve everything u set your mind to and once again like ive done for all these years ill be cheering for u. i know ill always be able to count on u no matter what and its such a piece of info i save in my heart in a very cozy spot. i really really am a privileged person just to know u and being able to communicate with you everyday. To more years of u and our friendship!! ðŸ¥‚ðŸ¥‚ðŸ¥‚ (also i hope u liked this little website kisses)</p>
